Necessary_parts:

1) Two photoresistors (try to find calibrated ones, so you don't need to calibrate them with potentiometers)
2) If the photoresistors are not calibrated, you have to buy to potentiometers
(Please watch the video on how to do this (tedious work though):

)

3) Wirings (male-male, female-male, female-female). These sets are usually available and are cheap.

4) Steppper motor 5v-28byj48 with respective driver (they are usually sold along with the drivers,
you can find its datasheet in the folder 001_datasheets)

5) Hexagonal wrench (Shestigrannik) 10 mm (it should be compatible with the STL model saddle_stepper.stl). This wrench will be used as
a pale between the base (some massive object which holds the whole construction) and the motor holder (saddle).

6) Some massive piece of wood (it can be for example 20x150x150 mm)

7) A microcontroller (Arduino Nano or Arduino Uno, or their alternative)

8) Three parts must be printed on a 3d printer (the STL files are in the folder 002_stls)
